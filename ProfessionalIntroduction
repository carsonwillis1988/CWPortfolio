Hardworking, detail-focused, and a commitment to learning and growing are but a portion of the keystone of my foundationâ€”precepts for which my passion and technical skills in cyber security are built. Having had access to technology my entire life and fueled by curiosity, my initial interest in cybersecurity began early. With breakneck speed, the necessity of tools like encryption, anti-virus software, and penetration testing became and remains paramount.   Keenly developed soft skills backed by 10+ years of corporate and customer-facing work experience. pragmatism, strong ethics, and respect for the law I am prepared to take the next steps in my career.
